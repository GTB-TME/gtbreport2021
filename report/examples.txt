### Figure 5.1: Notifications of TB cases (new and relapse cases, all forms) (black) compared with estimated TB incident cases (<span class="green_text">green</span>), 2000â€“`r report_year - 1`, globally and for WHO regions. <span class="subhead">Shaded areas represent uncertainty intervals.</span>

# Plot data is already prepared in dataframe called f5.1_data

# variables f5.1_global_inc, f5.1_global_inc_lohi, f5.1_global_newinc

There is still a large global gap between the estimated number of incident cases (`r f5.1_global_inc` million, range `r f5.1_global_inc_lohi` million, in `r report_year - 1`) and the number of people newly diagnosed (`r f5.1_global_newinc` million in `r report_year - 1`), due to underreporting of detected cases and underdiagnosis (if people with TB cannot access health care or are not diagnosed when they do).
