**UPDATES IN THIS REPORT**

Estimates of TB incidence and mortality in this report cover the period 2000–2020. Estimates of incidence and mortality disaggregated by age and sex, and for drug-resistant TB, are for 2020. The main country-specific updates are for estimates of TB incidence and mortality in 2020.

**1. Impact of COVID-19 disruptions in 2020**

Since 2006, estimates of TB disease burden have been produced using standard methods periodically reviewed by the WHO Global Task Force on TB Impact Measurement (*1*). However, given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (Chapter 1), estimates of TB disease burden in 2020 published in this Global TB Report required new methods based on dynamic models, informed by earlier-than-usual availability of TB notification data (the single best indicator of disruptions to essential TB services). Such models were also required to develop projections of disease burden in 2021 and beyond. There is growing interest in such projections and their implications for progress towards SDG and End TB Strategy milestones and targets. 

In February and March 2021, GTB initiated collaborations with Imperial College and Avenir Health.  These collaborations ensure that the modelling needed for estimation of TB disease burden in 2020 and projections for 2021 can build on collaborative work already undertaken for countries in the South-East Asia Region (*2*), which has allowed national TB programme managers to explore the impact of different scenarios of COVID disruptions on TB disease burden. 

The first stage of the modelling focused on 16 countries [***add link to webtool***]. These were prioritized based on the size of their contribution to the global shortfall in TB notifications in 2020 compared with 2019. The modelling assumes that reductions in notifications in 2020, relative to the expected number of monthly or quarterly notifications in 2020 based on extrapolation of pre-2020 trends, are attributable to delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation.

The dynamic models have several limitations. These include:

* No age structure in the population.

* No separate classification of cases into pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. Instead, an average infectiousness for both forms was assumed. 

* Drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) was not explicitly considered. This is because, with the exception of the Russian Federation, the available notification data were for all cases, with no disaggregation. Estimates of the burden of DR-TB were estimated based on previously published methods (*3*).

* Uncertainty about key parameters. This includes the extent to which TB transmission intensity has been affected by lockdowns and other population-level restrictions put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is little directly measured evidence about the different mechanisms that have been proposed (e.g. the potential for reductions in community TB transmission to be at least partially offset by increases in household transmission). The modelling uses a default assumption of a 50% reduction in TB transmission during periods of lockdown. Country-specific data about the durations for lockdowns have been compiled, with transmission reductions assumed during these periods only. 

For 111 low- and middle-income countries for which it was not possible to develop country-specific dynamic models within the available timeframe for inclusion in the Global TB Report 2021, a predictive statistical model was used based on the output from the 16 modelled countries. A distinction is made between high-income countries or countries with no shortfall in case detection in 2020 and the other countries. In the former group, incidence and mortality for 2020 are based on pre-2020 trends. In the latter group, incidence and mortality are calculated using the following steps: (*i*) calculating incidence and mortality for 2020 based on pre-2020 trends (based on previously published time series), (*ii*) predicting the incidence and mortality rate ratio (modelled under disruptions over a counterfactual rate based on pre-2020 trends) using regression models fitted to data in the 16 countries, using as predictor variables case detection in 2019 and its changes over 2019-2020 and ratios of mortality to incidence, (*iii*) taking the product of the estimate from step (*i*) with the predicted rate ratio from step (*ii*). 

**3. Drug-resistant TB**

As in last year’s WHO global TB report *(3)*, the annual incidence of multidrug- or rifampicin-resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB) was estimated using the following equation:
$$
I_{rr} =   I[(1-f)p_n((1-r) + r\rho)+fp_r]
$$
where *I* is overall TB incidence, $I_{rr}$​​​​ is the incidence of RR-TB, *f* is the cumulative risk for incident cases to receive a non-relapse retreatment (following failure or return after default), *r* is the proportion of incident TB cases that are relapses, *ρ* is the relative risk of MDR/RR-TB in relapse compared with new cases (first episodes) of TB, and *pn* and *pr* denote the proportions of new and previously treated cases that have MDR/RR-TB. Although the same equation was used, the parameter values for this year’s report are slightly different from those used for last year’s report (Tables A1 and A2), reflecting new data on levels of drug resistance (Chapter 2-3). These updated values (particularly in India and China where data from continuous surveillance are used in 2020 as compared with data from older surveys in last year's Global TB Report) resulted in a slightly lower global estimate of the incidence of MDR/RR-TB.

<div class="footnote"> 

^a^ For Zambia, both surveillance and survey data for 2020 were available.

^b^ Includes countries with no quality-approved data previously or no quality-approved data after 2005. In 2020, estimates were modelled for the first time for Argentina and Colombia, where the latest data source was a survey conducted in 2005.

^c^ Includes four countries that have never conducted a drug-resistance survey (Angola, Congo, Gabon and Liberia) and Sierra Leone, where the latest survey was conducted in 1997. Among the 43 countries in the 30 high TB burden countries and/or the 30 high MDR-TB burden countries lists, 39 have data on levels of drug resistance. Of these, four countries (Brazil, Central African Republic, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Papua New Guinea) rely on drug-resistance data gathered from subnational areas only. 

</div>

Out of 90 countries and territories with new data on levels of drug resistance:

* Three countries transitioned from reporting no data previously, to reporting quality-approved surveillance data in 2020: United Arab Emirates, Libya and Occupied Palestinian territory, including east Jerusalem.

* Eight countries transitioned from reporting survey data to reporting quality-approved surveillance data in 2020; the year of the latest survey is given for each country in brackets: Bolivia (1996), Burkina Faso (2017), China (2013), Ecuador (2002), India (2016), Kenya (2014), Nicaragua (2006), Togo (2018).

* New surveillance data were available for an additional 79 countries 

 Data from a repeat national anti-TB drug-resistance survey became available for Zambia; no new data from first-ever national anti-TB drug-resistance survey became available. In 2020–2021, drug-resistance surveys were being planned or implemented in ten countries, with the first nationwide surveys in four countries (Burundi, Chad, Haiti and Niger) and repeat surveys in six countries (Guinea, Madagascar, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal and Uzbekistan).

Among countries estimated to have more than 1000 incident cases of MDR/RR-TB in 2020, the updated estimate for 2020 was >10% lower than the estimate for 2019 in nine countries (China, Ghana, India, Kenya, Myanmar, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, Somalia and Zambia), with the main differences in incidence being observed for China and India followed by in Kenya. The updated estimate for 2020 was >10% higher than the estimate for 2019 in three countries (Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan). Reasons for these differences were due to availability of new survey data on prevalence of MDR/RR-TB among previously treated cases (Zambia), transition from survey to quality approved surveillance data (China, India, Kenya), and availability of new surveillance data for the remaining countries.

**4. Newly reported data and updated estimates from other agencies**

New data on TB mortality were reported to WHO between mid-2020 and mid-2021. Several countries reported historical data that were previously missing, or made corrections to previously reported data. Updated estimates of HIV prevalence and mortality were obtained from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in July 2021 *(11)* and updated cause of death data reported to WHO were incorporated, with no significant increase in the number of usable country-year data points compared with the previous year.

Most estimates covering  the period 2000-2019 are similar to those published last year. The impact of COVID-19 on estimates in 2020 is described in section 2.

**5. Estimates of the burden of TB in children**

Estimates of the burden of TB in children in 2020 were produced for this report using the same methods as those of last year. Estimation of the burden of TB disease in children remains particularly challenging, owing to the inconsistent quality of notification data for children, particularly in high TB burden countries. Cases among children are often notified based on inconsistent investigations, diagnostic criteria (and limited investigations of differential diagnoses) for childhood TB disease, leading to instances of overreporting; other cases may be diagnosed in paediatric hospitals and not reported to public health authorities, leading to underreporting; and other cases may not be diagnosed. The scarcity of nationwide population-based survey data results in large uncertainty when TB incidence is disaggregated by age group (reflected in wide uncertainty bounds). This considerably limits their usefulness for activities related to programme planning and evaluation.

Greater priority should be given to the quality of TB notification data for children, as well as the consistency of case definitions and coverage of reporting. Inventory studies specific to childhood TB would help to improve the quality of TB disease burden estimates for children and should be prioritized. Audits of medical records from random samples of childhood cases would provide valuable information on the quality of diagnoses and completeness of prescribed investigations, and should be conducted systematically in countries with a high burden of TB.

**6.** **Bacteriologically confirmable incidence of pulmonary TB**

Country-specific estimates of the number of incident cases of pulmonary TB that could be bacteriologically confirmed have been produced using similar methods as used last year. This has been done following growing interest in the use of such estimates in setting targets for the numbers of people with MDR/RR-TB that could be detected using available diagnostic tests, as well as concern about the increasing proportion of notified TB cases that are clinically diagnosed as opposed to bacteriologically confirmed. 

Estimates were produced as the product of a) estimated TB incidence b) the observed country-specific proportion of notified cases diagnosed with pulmonary TB and c) the expected proportion of pulmonary cases that could be bacteriologically confirmed if the best tests were used. The technical appendix provides further details. Estimates are available on the report’s data webpage (http://www.who.int/tb/data).



**UPDATES ANTICIPATED IN THE NEAR FUTURE**

Updates to estimates of disease burden are expected in 2021-2022 for India, following the completion of the country’s first-ever national TB prevalence survey. The survey investigations were put on hold during several months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic will further affect estimates of incidence and mortality for 2021 in many countries and dynamic modelling will be used in more countries in preparation for Global TB Report 2022. 

Chapter 3 discusses the impact and implications of the pandemic, including on incidence, mortality, case finding and notifications, and broader socioeconomic determinants of TB (e.g. poverty, undernutrition and income per capita). Chapter 8 discusses the impact on TB determinants in more depth.
