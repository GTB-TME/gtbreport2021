<h1>3.4 Drug-resistant TB: treatment</h1>
<p><em>Draft! Prepared 2021-09-24 using country-reported data CSV files dated 2021-09-13 and estimates files dated 2021-08-16.</em></p>
<p>Treatment for people diagnosed with rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB), isoniazid-resistant TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB, defined as resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin) requires regimens that include second-line drugs, such as bedaquiline and fluoroquinolones; these regimens are more expensive (≥US$ 1000 per person) and cause more side-effects than first-line treatments for drug-susceptible TB (<span class="refs"><a href="#refs">1</a></span>). Pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR-TB, defined as TB that is resistant to rifampicin and any fluoroquinolone) and XDR-TB (resistance to rifampicin, any fluoroquinolone and at least one of bedaquiline or linezolid) are even harder to treat.</p>
<p>Globally in 2020, 150 359 people were enrolled on treatment for MDR/RR-TB, down 15% from 177 100 in 2019. Most of those enrolled on treatment were adults (<span class="red"><a href="#fig--3-4-1">Fig. 3.4.1</a></span>). There was considerable country variation in treatment enrolment between 2009 and 2020 (<span class="red"><a href="#fig--3-4-2">Fig. 3.4.2</a></span>).</p>
<p>The cumulative total number of people reported as enrolled on treatment for MDR/RR-TB from 2018 to 2020 was 482 683, only 32% of the 5-year target (2018-2022) of 1.5 million that was set at the UN high-level meeting on TB in 2018 (<span class="red"><a href="#fig--3-4-3">Fig. 3.4.3</a></span>). For children specifically, the cumulative number was 12 219, only 11% of the 5-year target of 115 000.</p>
<p>Substantial improvements in treatment coverage at the global level require an intensification of efforts to diagnose and treat MDR/RR-TB. This requires one or more of the following to be increased:</p>
<ul>
<li>the proportion of people with TB who are detected and, of these, the proportion for whom TB is bacteriologically confirmed;</li>
<li>the proportion of people with bacteriologically confirmed TB who are tested for drug resistance; and</li>
<li>the proportion of people diagnosed with MDR/RR-TB who are enrolled in treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Globally in 2018 (the latest patient cohort for which data are available), the treatment success rate for people treated for MDR/RR-TB with second-line regimens was 59%; this has improved steadily in recent years, from 50% in 2012 (<span class="red"><a href="#fig--3-4-4">Fig. 3.4.4</a></span>). Among WHO regions, the treatment success rate in 2018 ranged from 56% in the European Region to 69% in the African Region (<span class="red"><a href="#fig--3-4-5">Fig. 3.4.5</a></span>).</p>
<p>By the end of 2020, 109 countries were using bedaquiline as part of treatment for drug-resistant TB (DR-TB), 90 were using all-oral longer regimens for the treatment of MDR/RR-TB and 65 were using shorter regimens for the treatment of MDR/RR-TB (<span class="red"><a href="#fig--3-4-6">Fig. 3.4.6</a></span>, <span class="red"><a href="#fig--3-4-7">Fig. 3.4.7</a></span>, <span class="red"><a href="#fig--3-4-8">Fig. 3.4.8</a></span>). At least some people diagnosed with DR-TB were being monitored for adverse events in most countries (<span class="red"><a href="#fig--3-4-9">Fig. 3.4.9</a></span>).</p>
